# inter-sdk-java

## Execution Mode

- To execute methods from the InterSdk, an external application that includes it as a project dependency is required.

- To verify that a method is functioning correctly, you can run the functional tests included in the project. These tests can be found in the directory `src/main/java/functests/FunctionalTestRunner.java`.

Running Functional Tests

1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies set up in your project.
2. Navigate to the `functests` directory.
3. Execute the `FunctionalTestRunner.java` file to run the tests and check for correct method execution.
4. Review the output to confirm that all tests pass successfully.

This approach will help you ensure that the integration with the InterSdk is working as intended.
